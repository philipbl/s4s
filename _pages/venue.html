    <!-- <p><span class="style_bold">Q: Where do I park? (See map below the
            answers.)</span></p>
    <p>A: Coming soon...</p>
    <p><span class="style_bold">Q: How do I get there?</span>
        A: Since this is an air quality conference, we'd love for you to
        take mass transit. Take the FrontRunner to North Temple Station then
        take Trax Greenline westward to the "1940 West, North Temple"
        station. UDAQ is located about two blocks to the north-northwest. </p>

    <p><span class="style_bold">Q: What's up for lunch? </span><br />
        A: Everyone who registers will get a box lunch to enjoy while
        looking at the posters. We will have a mix of lunch types, including
        vegetarian. Please try to be flexible
        with your choice of meals as we are just guessing at the selection
        quantity breakdowns. </p>
    <p><span class="style_bold">Q: Why are Zoom registrations required
            to pay a registration fee? </span><br />
        A: It is twenty bucks. At such a low amount it is too much work for
        the small organizing committee to deal with the additional workload
        of separating out different registration levels. Adding the Zoom
        option is already additional workload. It is a face-to-face
        conference that is adhering to all CDC and local health
        requirements. We do strongly encourage the use of masks by everyone.
        We believe that this will be a safe environment and we encourage you
        to attend in person. We'll have a name tag for you and look forward
        to seeing you. </p>
    <p><span class="style_bold">Q: Are masks required? </span><br />
        A: Short answer is "no." We will follow the Health Department
        requirements at the time. As none of us knows
        the health status of the person sitting next to you, we feel that
        the polite and responsible thing to do is wear a mask. If you are
        experiencing COVID or any respiratory symptoms, please use the Zoom
        link that will be sent to all registered participants just before
        the conference starts. </p>
    <p><span class="style_bold">Q: When will we get the Zoom link? </span><br />
        A: All registered participants will get the Zoom link via email just
        prior to the start of the conference. Since everyone is required to
        pay a registration fee, we ask that you don't share this link with
        others. Thank you. </p> -->
