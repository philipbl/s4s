Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is a complex multifactorial disease affecting over 30 million people in the United States (9.4% of the population) and another 84 million pre-diabetic adults well on their way to becoming diabetic. Over the last two decades, research using traditional statistical methods on the effects of air pollution (AP) on a number of health outcomes including DM have been increasing. These methods assess a single AP component, while controlling for others. However, results have been conflicting possibly stemming from the fact that AP is not a single homogenous entity. The composition of air pollution depends on the source(s), with some components of AP possibly affecting health more than others.

Humans are exposed to AP mixtures. Therefore, assessing all of the AP components together has the capacity to show possible synergisms between two or more of these constituents on health, which traditional regression models may not be able to capture. Machine learning has increasingly been used in atmospheric science to model AP. In this study, we employed an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, k-means clustering, on daily AP data from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) combined with annual DM incidence data from the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to explore possible associations.

K-means cluster analysis was performed on 53,284 observations collected from 2003-2012 to partition the following AP constituents into groups that were matched with change in DM incidence: carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter with a diameter of 10µm or less (PM10), and particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5µm or less (PM2.5). Change in annual CDC DM incidence was calculated by subtracting annual DM incidence from the following year for each county across the US that had data between 2003-2012.
The k-means analysis resulted in six clusters: cluster 1 (n = 28,525), cluster 2 (n =7,502), cluster 3 (n = 2,571), cluster 4 (n = 10,506), cluster 5 (n = 3,712), and cluster 6 (n = 468) observations. The change of annual DM incidence statistically different in all but clusters 3 and 5.

Cluster 6 had the greatest increase in change in DM incidence (0.19 increase per 1000) with the highest mean level of CO, NO, NO2, PM10 and PM2.5, but not with SO2 and O3. However, the mean SO2 level was greater than twice the dataset mean. In comparison, Cluster 1 had the largest decrease in DM incidence (-0.19 decrease per 1000) and the lowest levels of CO, NO, NO2, PM10, PM2,5 and SO2. Cluster 5, showed the next highest increase in DM incidence (0.06 increase per 1000), had the greatest mean concentration of SO2, and elevated levels of all other AP constituents with the exception of NO.

Using an unsupervised k-means algorithm, we showed that AP components are related to increased incidence of DM even when average concentrations are below the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.
