                <h1>2022, Air Quality: Science for Solutions 5 </h1>

                <em>Air Quality: Science for Solutions</em> is an annual
                conference on air quality, especially for Utah and the Intermountain
                West. &nbsp;It began with a pair of conferences by the same name hosted
                by the Utah Department of Environmental Quality, Division of Air
                Quality; the Program for Air Quality Health and Society at the
                University of Utah; and the Utah State University Bingham
                Entrepreneurship &amp; Energy Research Center in 2015.<br />
                <br />
                The mission of this conference is to bridge divides that separate
                researchers of various disciplines from each other, from
                professionals in the industrial and regulatory realms, and from the
                public, and to facilitate a cross-pollination of ideas working
                towards the
                development of solutions.<br />

                            of California Davis with majors in Environmental Toxicology
                            and Physiology. She worked for the Hawaii Department of

                            and then came to Utah where she has lived for the last 25
                            years. Previous to working for the State of Utah, she worked
                            for 19 years at the Tooele Chemical Demilitarization
                            Facility where she was the Environmental Manager, and
                            oversaw the successful clean closure of the hazardous waste
                            incinerator and other waste management units that safely
                            destroyed the weapons and chemical agents. <br />

                            <strong>Ryan Bares</strong>’s career in air quality started
                            while conducting research at the University of Utah in the
                            Departments of Biology and Atmospheric Sciences.&nbsp; During
                            this time, Ryan participated in a wide array of studies
                            looking at the convergence of anthropogenic emissions,
                            atmospheric transport, and the resulting atmospheric
                            chemistry.&nbsp; Through this research he gained a great
                            appreciation for policy solutions that bridge the gap
                            between good research and real world solutions aimed at
                            addressing our pressing air quality challenges. This
                            appreciation led Ryan to his current position, where he
                            serves as the State Implementation Plan coordinator for
                            ozone pollution along the Wasatch Front. <br />

                    science. Topic areas include atmospheric chemistry, health impacts,
                    meteorology, emissions, modeling, and public policy. While this
                    conference specializes in topics associated with air quality issues
                    important to Utah and the Intermountain West, presentations on air

                    crosspollination of ideas between fields of study. The oral talks
                    are 10 to 12 minutes long with 3 minutes for questions and change over to
