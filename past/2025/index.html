                <p><em>Air Quality: Science for Solutions</em> is an annual
                    conference on air quality, especially for Utah and the Intermountain
                    West. &nbsp;It began with a pair of conferences by the same name hosted
                    by the Utah Department of Environmental Quality, Division of Air
                    Quality; the Program for Air Quality Health and Society at the
                    University of Utah; and the Utah State University Bingham
                    Entrepreneurship &amp; Energy Research Center in 2015.</p>

                <p>The mission of this conference is to bridge divides that separate
                    researchers of various disciplines from each other, from
                    professionals in the industrial and regulatory realms, and from the
                    public, and to facilitate a cross-pollination of ideas working
                    towards the development of solutions.</p>

                <b>Prof. Lee D. Hansen</b> is Prof. Emeritus in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Brigham Young University, Provo, UT. During his career, he has published over 300 papers in peer-reviewed journals on a wide range of topics. His specialties are air pollution, calorimetry, thermodynamics, and the kinetics and energetics of biological systems.

                <h2>Topics</h2>
                <p>The subject of this conference is air
                    science. Topic areas include atmospheric chemistry, health impacts,
                    meteorology, emissions, modeling, and public policy. While this
                    conference specializes in topics associated with air quality issues
                    important to Utah and the Intermountain West, presentations on air
                    quality topics that are related in some way will also be considered.</p>
                <h2>Oral Sessions</h2>
                <p>There are no parallel sessions. Oral presentations
                    should be understandable, at least in part, to air
                    scientists from all fields. A major goal of this conference is the
                    crosspollination of ideas between fields of study. The oral talks
                    are 10 to 12 minutes long with 3 minutes for questions and change over to
                    the next talk. </p>
                <h2>Poster Sessions</h2>
                <p>The posters will be viewable at the
                    conference for the duration of the conference. The breaks will be
                    held near the posters to facilitate interaction. There will be a
                    student poster competition as well. </p>
                <!-- <h2>
            UDAQ Academic Stakeholder Meeting</h2>
        <p>This is an independent group of regional
            academics involved in ongoing air quality research. A special
            meeting for the members of the UDAQ Academic Stakeholders group will
            be scheduled with this conference. Details will be released once the
            conference agenda has been finalized in the next week or two.
            Details on that group and the schedule will be announced on this
            webpage soon.</p> -->
