    <h1>2022, Air Quality: Science for Solutions 5 </h1>

    <em>Air Quality: Science for Solutions</em> is an annual
    conference on air quality, especially for Utah and the Intermountain
    West. &nbsp;It began with a pair of conferences by the same name hosted
    by the Utah Department of Environmental Quality, Division of Air
    Quality; the Program for Air Quality Health and Society at the
    University of Utah; and the Utah State University Bingham
    Entrepreneurship &amp; Energy Research Center in 2015.<br />
    <br />
    The mission of this conference is to bridge divides that separate
    researchers of various disciplines from each other, from
    professionals in the industrial and regulatory realms, and from the
    public, and to facilitate a cross-pollination of ideas working
    towards the
    development of solutions.<br />

            <td><strong>Welcome and Opening Q&amp;A will be discussing ozone and
                    State Implementation Plan (SIP) issues. The three person
                    UDAQ panel
                    is Becky Close, Sheila Vance, and Ryan Bares.&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Becky Close</strong> is the Utah Division of Air
                Quality Environmental Program Manager overseeing the Policy
                Section, which coordinates state implementation plans and
                administers grant and incentive programs to reduce harmful
                air emissions. Becky has worked at DAQ for six years, and
                was previously the PM2.5 coordinator. Prior to DAQ, Becky
                earned a master's degree in Environmental Science from the
                University of Utah, and worked on legacy atomic bomb waste
                remediation for an environmental consulting firm in Los
                Alamos, NM. Growing up on the western slope of Colorado, and
                having lived in the intermountain west most of her life,
                Becky enjoys exploring the outdoors with her family while
                hiking, backpacking, mountain biking, running, and skiing.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Sheila Vance</strong> is an Environmental Scientist
                who has been with the Utah Division of Air Quality for a
                little over 6 years with a focus on winter time ozone
                pollution in the Uinta Basin. She has been a part of air
                quality rule development for oil and gas emission sources
                and research projects involving studies on the sources of
                VOC and NOx emissions in the Uinta Basin and impacts on the
                formation of ozone. She has a BS degree from the University
                of California Davis with majors in Environmental Toxicology
                and Physiology. She worked for the Hawaii Department of
                Health in their Hazardous Waste Division for several years
                and then came to Utah where she has lived for the last 25
                years. Previous to working for the State of Utah, she worked
                for 19 years at the Tooele Chemical Demilitarization
                Facility where she was the Environmental Manager, and
                oversaw the successful clean closure of the hazardous waste
                incinerator and other waste management units that safely
                destroyed the weapons and chemical agents. <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Ryan Bares</strong>â€™s career in air quality started
                while conducting research at the University of Utah in the
                Departments of Biology and Atmospheric Sciences.&nbsp; During
                this time, Ryan participated in a wide array of studies
                looking at the convergence of anthropogenic emissions,
                atmospheric transport, and the resulting atmospheric
                chemistry.&nbsp; Through this research he gained a great
                appreciation for policy solutions that bridge the gap
                between good research and real world solutions aimed at
                addressing our pressing air quality challenges. This
                appreciation led Ryan to his current position, where he
                serves as the State Implementation Plan coordinator for
                ozone pollution along the Wasatch Front. <br />

                racing. Ashley has worked hard for several years influencing
                state and local air quality policy. In 2017, she was
                appointed by Governor Herbert to the state Air Quality
                Policy Advisory Board and is currently serving her second
                term as Vice-Chair. She is also a member of the Salt Lake

    <h2>Conference Format:</h2>
    <p>The conference will return to a face-to-face format this year.
        There might be a virtual option if we can make that happen, details
        will be announced as we figure it out. </p>
    <h2 class="auto-style6">Topics</h2>
    <p class="auto-style7">The subject of this conference is air
        science. Topic areas include atmospheric chemistry, health impacts,
        meteorology, emissions, modeling, and public policy. While this
        conference specializes in topics associated with air quality issues
        important to Utah and the Intermountain West, presentations on air
        quality topics that are related in some way will also be considered.</p>
    <h2 class="auto-style6">
        <a href="PastConferences/PastConferenceDocs/AQSfS2021/default.html">Oral Sessions
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p class="auto-style7">There are no parallel sessions. Oral presentations
        should be understandable, at least in part, to air
        scientists from all fields. A major goal of this conference is the
        crosspollination of ideas between fields of study. The oral talks
        are 10 to 12 minutes long with 3 minutes for questions and change over to
        the next talk. </p>
    <h2 class="auto-style6">
        <a href="PastConferences/PastConferenceDocs/AQSfS2021/default.html#Poster1">Poster Sessions
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p class="auto-style7">The posters will be viewable at the
        conference for the duration of the conference. The breaks will be
        held near the posters to facilitate interaction. There will be a
        student poster competition as well. </p>
    <h2 class="auto-style6">
        UDAQ Academic Stakeholder Meeting</h2>
    <p class="auto-style7">This is an independent group of regional
        academics involved in ongoing air quality research. A special
        meeting for the members of the UDAQ Academic Stakeholders group will
        be scheduled with this conference. Details will be released once the
        conference agenda has been finalized in the next week or two.
        Details on that group and the schedule will be announced on this
        webpage soon.</p>
