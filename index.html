        <p><em>Air Quality: Science for Solutions</em> is an annual
            conference on air quality, especially for Utah and the Intermountain
            West. &nbsp;It began with a pair of conferences by the same name hosted
            by the Utah Department of Environmental Quality, Division of Air
            Quality; the Program for Air Quality Health and Society at the
            University of Utah; and the Utah State University Bingham
            Entrepreneurship &amp; Energy Research Center in 2015.</p>

        <p>The mission of this conference is to bridge divides that separate
            researchers of various disciplines from each other, from
            professionals in the industrial and regulatory realms, and from the
            public, and to facilitate a cross-pollination of ideas working
            towards the development of solutions.</p>

        <h2>Topics</h2>
        <p>The subject of this conference is air
            science. Topic areas include atmospheric chemistry, health impacts,
            meteorology, emissions, modeling, and public policy. While this
            conference specializes in topics associated with air quality issues
            important to Utah and the Intermountain West, presentations on air
            quality topics that are related in some way will also be considered.</p>
        <h2>Oral Sessions</h2>
        <p>There are no parallel sessions. Oral presentations
            should be understandable, at least in part, to air
            scientists from all fields. A major goal of this conference is the
            crosspollination of ideas between fields of study.</p>
        <h2>Poster Sessions</h2>
        <p>The posters will be viewable at the
            conference for the duration of the conference. The breaks will be
            held near the posters to facilitate interaction. There will be a
            student poster competition as well. </p>
        <!-- <h2>
            UDAQ Academic Stakeholder Meeting</h2>
        <p>This is an independent group of regional
            academics involved in ongoing air quality research. A special
            meeting for the members of the UDAQ Academic Stakeholders group will
            be scheduled with this conference. Details will be released once the
            conference agenda has been finalized in the next week or two.
            Details on that group and the schedule will be announced on this
            webpage soon.</p> -->
