    <h1>Air Quality: Science for Solutions - 2023 </h1>

    <em>Air Quality: Science for Solutions</em> is an annual
    conference on air quality, especially for Utah and the Intermountain
    West. &nbsp;It began with a pair of conferences by the same name hosted
    by the Utah Department of Environmental Quality, Division of Air
    Quality; the Program for Air Quality Health and Society at the
    University of Utah; and the Utah State University Bingham
    Entrepreneurship &amp; Energy Research Center in 2015.<br />
    <br />
    The mission of this conference is to bridge divides that separate
    researchers of various disciplines from each other, from
    professionals in the industrial and regulatory realms, and from the
    public, and to facilitate a cross-pollination of ideas working
    towards the
    development of solutions.<br />

                    The Challenge of O3 and PM in the Western U.S: How low can we go?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our mission as air quality scientists is to improve public
                    health and at the same meet the national air quality
                    standards. To this end, it is essential to understand the
                    full range of sources of key pollutants. The western U.S.
                    has a unique blend of sources for PM2.5 and O3. Our job is
                    to understand these sources and do our best to control those
                    we can control. In this overview presentation, I will
                    summarize what we know about PM and O3 sources in the
                    Western U.S. with a particular emphasis on the Salt Lake
                    City/Northern Wasatch Front region.

    <h2>Conference Format:</h2>
    <p>The conference will return to a face-to-face format this year.
        There might be a virtual option if we can make that happen, details
        will be announced as we figure it out. </p>
    <h2 class="auto-style6">Topics</h2>
    <p class="auto-style7">The subject of this conference is air
        science. Topic areas include atmospheric chemistry, health impacts,
        meteorology, emissions, modeling, and public policy. While this
        conference specializes in topics associated with air quality issues
        important to Utah and the Intermountain West, presentations on air
        quality topics that are related in some way will also be considered.</p>
    <h2 class="auto-style6">Oral Sessions</h2>
    <p class="auto-style7">There are no parallel sessions. Oral presentations
        should be understandable, at least in part, to air
        scientists from all fields. A major goal of this conference is the
        crosspollination of ideas between fields of study. The oral talks
        are 10 to 12 minutes long with 3 minutes for questions and change over to
        the next talk. </p>
    <h2 class="auto-style6">Poster Sessions</h2>
    <p class="auto-style7">The posters will be viewable at the
        conference for the duration of the conference. The breaks will be
        held near the posters to facilitate interaction. There will be a
        student poster competition as well. </p>
    <h2 class="auto-style6">
        UDAQ Academic Stakeholder Meeting</h2>
    <p class="auto-style7">This is an independent group of regional
        academics involved in ongoing air quality research. A special
        meeting for the members of the UDAQ Academic Stakeholders group will
        be scheduled with this conference. Details will be released once the
        conference agenda has been finalized in the next week or two.
        Details on that group and the schedule will be announced on this
        webpage soon.</p>
