        C. Arden Pope, III is the Mary Lou Fulton Professor of Economics at
        Brigham Young University. He has a PhD from Iowa State University
        (1981) and was a Fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health
        (1992/93). He has conducted or collaborated on seminal studies on
        health effects of air pollution and has authored or coauthored 200+
        research including articles in New England Journal of Medicine,
        JAMA, Lancet, PNAS, AJRCCM, and Circulation. He is one of the
        world’s most cited and recognized experts on health effects of air
        pollution (Web of Science/Clarivate Analytics, Highly Cited
        Researcher; 100,000+ Google Scholar citations). He has served on or
        chaired various scientific advisory and oversight boards and
        committees (including U.S. EPA Science Advisory Board and Chair of
        the U.S. EPA Advisory Council on Clean Air Compliance Analysis). He
        has also been a recipient of multiple research and teaching awards
        (including Utah Governor’s Medal for Science &amp; Technology; BYU’s
        Karl G. Maeser Distinguished Faculty Lecturer; American Association
        for Aerosol Research and International Society for Aerosols in
        Medicine’s Thomas T. Mercer Joint Prize; Utah Academy of Sciences,
        Arts, and Letters, Gardner Prize; and American College of Chest
        Physicians, Honorary Fellow Award).</p>

        Plenary Abstract:</p>
    <p class="auto-style6">
        <span
            style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;">
            Almost unbelievably, it is estimated that air pollution is a top ten
            risk factor contributing to global burden of disease.
            Epidemiological and related studies indicate that short-term
            exposure to air pollution exacerbates existing cardiovascular and
            pulmonary disease and increases the risk of becoming symptomatic,
            requiring medical attention, or even dying. Large prospective cohort
            studies have provided evidence that long-term repeated exposure to
            air pollution, especially fine particulate matter is associated with
            increased risk of chronic pulmonary and cardiovascular disease and
            death. Extrapolation of the epidemiological evidence across the
            global population results in estimates of approximately 3 to 7
            million deaths attributed to exposure to air pollution. Given the
            staggering estimated health costs and the related public policy
            challenges, it is important, even imperative, that we understand the
            quantity, quality, and limitations of the evidence. This
            presentation will review evidence from the prospective cohort
            studies and evaluate its consistency, coherency, and plausibility.</span>
