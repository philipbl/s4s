Painting a fuller picture: Residential pollutant emissions in the Salt Lake Valley

With increasing population in the Salt Lake Valley we are finding it necessary to build more multi home structures and develop previously uninhabited land to keep up with housing demand. I have chosen to look at area source air pollutant emissions, specifically from residential homes in the Salt Lake Valley. I am investigating the impact pollutant emissions from new vs. old homes will have on air quality in the Salt Lake Valley. I will be selecting several homes in the valley and calculating the average pollutant emissions produced over a year. I will compare older homes to newer homes to determine if there is a difference in production. To gather my data I developed a survey for homeowners looking at sources of precursor emissions in the home, specifically - CO - NOX - VOC- NH3-SO2. These precursor emissions are important to the secondary formation of PM2.5, which makes up the majority of PM2.5 concentrations in the Salt Lake Valley during bad air quality days. This data is the foundation in determining the most cost-effective course of action in combating emissions from area sources. Implications of this research include policy decisions, such as whether its more effective to incentivize older homes to upgrade or create new building standards on future development. This research can be used in conjunction with the study of point and mobile source air pollutants to develop a fuller picture of air quality in the Salt Lake valley.
